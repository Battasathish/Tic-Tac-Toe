# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game where participants take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to get three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Players alternate turns, strategizing to block their opponent while aiming to create their own line of three.
